== vs === in javascript
The == operator performs a loose equality comparison that performs type coercion if
necessary to make the comparison possible. The === operator, on the other hand, performs
a strict equality comparison that does not perform type coercion and requires the operands to
have the same type (as well as the same value).

1 == '1'  -- True
1 === '1'  -- False
